pick 0b98fff - Adds a visible message when the larva grows into a humanoid. - Removes some duplicated code in alien growth code (larva-to-humanoid, praetorian and queen now all use the same proc). - Alien drones can no longer evolve into a praetorian while inside a pipe (praetorian can't ventcrawl) or other containers. - Removed an unneeded check in larva_evolve/fire(). - Fixes bug where a larva could evolve despite being incapacitated/dead during the selection of the alien caste. - Remove outdated code in monkey/attack_hand about disarm and grab intent. - Evolving into a royal alien no longer delets what you hold in your hands and the content of your stomach.
