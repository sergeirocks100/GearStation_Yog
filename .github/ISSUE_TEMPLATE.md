[Round ID]: # (Including the round helps a lot as it allows us to quickly find more information. It can be found in the Status panel.)

[Reproduction]: # (Explain your issue in detail, including the steps to reproduce it. Issues without proper reproduction steps or explanation are open to being ignored/closed by maintainers.)

[For Admins]: # (Oddities induced by var-edits and other admin tools are not necessarily bugs. Verify that your issues occur under regular circumstances before reporting them.)
