### Intent of your Pull Request

<<<<<<< HEAD
Explain what the purpose of your PR is.
Mention if you tested your changes. If you changed a map, make sure you used the mapmerge tool.

Mention if your PR is related to an issue.
You can type "Fixes issue #6" and issue 6 will be automatically closed when your pull request is merged. This is much easier for everyone.

Edit the changelog at the bottom for changes that are noticeable by the players. Remove it if this isn't the case.
If you add a name after the ':cl', that name will be used in the changelog. Leave it empty to use your GitHub name.
Include [admin] in the title if it's something admin related.
Include [s] in the title if you don't want it to be announced on discord and the server.

<!-- You can use multiple of the same prefix (they're only used for the icon ingame) and delete the unneeded ones. Despite some of the tags, changelogs should generally represent how a player might be affected by the changes rather than a summary of the PR's contents. -->
