changes: 
  - rscdel: "Clockwork Marauders are no longer totally invincible to damage unless a holy weapon was involved."
  - rscadd: "Clockwork Marauders will take damage when attacked, but unless they're fighting excessive amounts, they'll be forced to return to their host before they'd normally die."
  - experiment: "A holy weapon held in either hand in the presence of a marauder will massively increase the damage they take, making it much more likely the marauder can be killed."
  - tweak: "Clockwork Marauders do slightly less damage at low fatigue levels."
  - rscadd: "Clockwork Marauders now have a chance to block melee attacks, negating the damage from them, and an additional chance to immediately counter, attacking whoever tried to attack them."
  - wip: "If Ratvar has awoken, Marauders have a much higher chance to block and counter, will block thrown items and projectiles, and gradually regenerate."
  - experiment: "Clockwork Marauders no longer have a verb to communicate; they instead use :b to do so."
