changes: 
  - rscdel: "The Teleport Other, Veil, Imbue, Reveal, Disguise, Blood Drain, Timestop, Stun, Deafen, Blind, Armaments, Construct Shell and Summon Tome runes are gone."
  - rscadd: "Disguise, Veil/Reveal, Construct Shell and Armaments are now talismans. The Construction talisman requires 25 sheets of metal."
  - rscadd: "Cultists will now receive a warning when attempting to use emergency communion or create the Nar-Sie rune"
  - rscadd: "Cultists can now create talismans with a super-simple Talisman-Creation rune. It takes about 10 seconds to invoke and will present a menu of all the talisman choices available. Its as simple as tossing the paper on, clicking the rune, and selecting your talisman."
  - rscadd: "Cultists now have a proc, \"How to Play\" that will give a basic explanation of how to succeed as a cultist."
  - rscadd: "The new Talisman of Horror is a stealthy talisman that will cause hallucinations in the victim. Great for undermining security without having to commit to murder them in middle of the hall."
  - rscadd: "Creating the Summon Nar-Sie rune does takes slightly less time, but now adds a 3x3 square of red barrier shields (60hp each) to prevent the rune-scriber from being bumped by other idiots. This works in conjunction with the rune's warning to give crew a chance to stop the summoning. Manifest ghost has a weaker 1x1 shield to prevent bumps as well."
  - rscadd: "Talismans are now color-coded by their effect so you can easily organize and deploy talismans."
  - rscadd: "You can now make colored paper in the washing machine using crayons or stamps, honk."
  - rscadd: "The Electromagnetic Disruption rune will now scale with the number of cultists invoking the rune. **A full 9-cultist invocation will EMP the entire station!**"
  - rscadd: "Armaments will now give the recipient a new cult bola."
  - rscadd: "The new Talisman of Shackling will apply handcuffs directly to the victim. These cuffs will disappear when removed."
  - tweak: "Cult slur is a little less potent so victims might be able to squeeze in a coherent word or two if you let them keep jabbering on the radio, stun talismans now have less of a health cost and the stun is back to 10 seconds, from 9."
  - tweak: "Rune and Talisman names now give a much clearer idea of what they do."
  - experiment: "The following changes are courtesy of ChangelingRain"
  - rscadd: "The Teleport rune now allows cultists to select which rune to teleport to, and teleports everything on it."
  - rscadd: "Veil and Reveal are merged into Talisman of Veiling. Veiling has two uses, the first use will hide and the second use will reveal."
  - rscadd: "New icons for the cult bola"
  - tweak: "You can now attack fellow cultists with a Talisman of Arming to arm them with robes and a sword."
  - tweak: "You can now only place one rune per tile."
  - tweak: "Ghosts are notified when a new manifest rune is created."
