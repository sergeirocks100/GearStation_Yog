  - rscadd: "You can make a split bag of holding look like a whole bag by taking another bag of holding, then using scalpel followed by hemostat to \"disable\" it (again don't cancel during hemostat part), then \"graft\" it onto a split bag to make it look whole. You can even split it again if you really want."
  - rscadd: "You can wear a bag of holding on your head to look out the other side."
