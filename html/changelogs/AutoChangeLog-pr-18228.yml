  - rscadd: "The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles, and windoors."
  - rscadd: "The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill, in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy."
