changes: 
  - experiment: "A number of popular stunning spells have undergone balance changes. Note that for the most part the stuns themselves are untouched."
  - experiment: "Lightning Bolt Changes:"
  - rscdel: "You can no longer throw the bolt whenever you want, it will fire itself once it's done charging."
  - rscadd: "Getting hit by a bolt will do a flat 30 burn now, as opposed to scaling with how long the wizard spent charging the spell. Unless said wizard made a habit of charging lightning bolt to near maximum every time this is a buff to damage."
  - rscdel: "Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage."
  - rscadd: "Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number of bolts you can be hit by in a single casting is three, and the maximum amount of damage you could take for that is 60 burn."
  - experiment: "Magic Missile Changes:"
  - rscdel: "Cooldown raised to 20 seconds, up from 15"
  - rscadd: "Cooldown reduction from taking the spell multiple times raised from 1.5 seconds to 3.5 seconds. Rank 5 magic missile now has a cooldown of 6 seconds, down from 9, and is effectively a permastun."
  - experiment: "Time Stop Changes:"
  - rscadd: "Time Stop field now persists for 10 seconds, up from 9"
  - rscdel: "Cooldown raised to 50 seconds, up from 40"
  - rscadd: "Cooldown reduction from taking the spell multiple times raised from  7.75 seconds to 10 seconds. Rank 5 time stop now has a cooldown of 10 seconds, up from 9, and is effectively a permastun."
