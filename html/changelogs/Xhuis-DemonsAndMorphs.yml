  - tweak: "When a morph changes form, a message is shown to nearby people. This also happens upon undisguising."
  - tweak: "Morphs now have an attack sound and message."
  - tweak: "The Spawn Morph event now plays a sound to the chosen candidate."
  - tweak: "Slaughter demons (and other creatures with blood crawl) now take two seconds to emerge from blood pools. Entering is still instantaneous."
  - tweak: "The demon heart's sprite has been updated."
  - tweak: "Eating a demon heart now surgically implants the heart into your chest. If the heart is removed from you, you lose the ability. Someone else can eat the heart to gain the ability."
  - tweak: "Blood Crawl no longer has a 1-second cooldown, instead having none."
  - tweak: "You can no longer hold items when attempting to Blood Crawl, nor can you use any items while Blood Crawling."

  - tweak: "Slaughter demons now store devoured creatures, and will drop them upon death."
  - tweak: "Revenants now have the ability to speak to the dead."
  - tweak: "Revenant abilities now have icons."
  - tweak: "Malfunction no longer EMPs a specific area - it will instead EMP nearby machines directly and stun cyborgs. Dominators are immune to this."
  - tweak: "Revenants now have directional sprites."
  - tweak: "Overload Lights now has a smaller radius."
  - tweak: "Defile no longer corrupts tiles."
  - tweak: "When glimmering residue reforms, the game will attempt to place the old revenant in control of the new one. If this cannot be done, it will find a random candidate."

  - tweak: "The Spawn Slaughter Demon event now plays a sound to the chosen candidate."
