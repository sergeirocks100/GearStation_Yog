changes: 
  - experimental: "Cultists will now be able to create all runes without needing to research or collect words. This is subject to change."
  - tweak: "Cult code has been significantly improved and will run much faster and be more responsive."
  - tweak: "Conversion runes can now be invoked with less than three cultists, but take a small amount of time to convert the target."
  - tweak: "Armor runes will only outfit the user with standard armor, rather than having different loadouts for different worn clothing items."
  - tweak: "Astral Journey runes will now pull the user back to the rune if they are moved. The user also has a different color while on the rune."
  - tweak: "Free Cultist has been removed. Summon Cultist now works even if the target is restrained."
  - tweak: "Sacrifice and Raise Dead runes now offer more precise target selection."
  - soundadd: "Sacrifice runes now have different sounds, and gib rather than dust (assuming the target is not a silicon)."
  - tweak: "There is no longer a maximum cap on active runes."
  - tweak: "Runes have been renamed to Rites. For instance, the Teleport rune is now the Rite of Translocation. The only exception to this is the rune to summon Nar-Sie, which is a Ritual."
  - tweak: "Nar-Sie now has a new summon sound."
  - tweak: "The Nar-Sie summon rune has a new 3x3 sprite."
  - tweak: "The stun rune no longer stuns cultists."
  - rscadd: "The Rite of False Truths had been added, that will make all nearby runes appear as if they were drawn in crayon."
  - rscadd: "Runes can now be examined by cultists to determine their name, function, and words."
