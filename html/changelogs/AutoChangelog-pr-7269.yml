  - rscadd: "Air spreads much more quickly now - If there is a pressure difference, it spreads instantly. This means that if you break a window in a hallway, all the air gets sucked out immediately"
  - rscadd: "Air vents are now buffed - A single air vent can refill a decently sized room in about a minute now. Likewise, a scrubber can empty a room pretty quickly now."
  - rscadd: "Air vents now have a space shutoff function - if it detects that it's venting is being immediately sucked into space, it will shut off for 20 seconds - during these 20 seconds it will blink yellow to indicate that it is in space shutoff mode."
  - rscadd: "Firelocks now automatically close to prevent air from escaping into space."
  - rscadd: "Pairs of firelocks now automatically airlock to prevent air from escaping when going through"
  - rscadd: "Firelocks can now be opened by bumping, if it determines not much air will escape and no fire alarm is triggered"
  - tweak: "Distro pumps start out maxed"
  - rscadd: "There is now a delay along with a warning message when trying to open a firelock with a pressure difference."
