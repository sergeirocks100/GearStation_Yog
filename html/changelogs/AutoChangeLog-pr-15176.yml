changes: 
  - experiment: "Blob expansion is faster near the expanding blob, but slower further away from it."
  - tweak: "Blob spores produce a slightly larger smoke cloud when dying. Sporing Pods spores and blob zombies produce the current small cloud."
  - rscdel: "Blobbernauts can no longer pull anything at all."
  - tweak: "Blobbernauts health reduced to 200, but blobbernauts now take half brute damage."
  - tweak: "Blobbernauts now take massive damage from fire."
  - tweak: "Blobbernauts do approximately 3 more damage when attacking."
  - wip: "Replicating Foam will expand more actively when damaged."
  - rscadd: "Adds Electromagnetic Web, which is light blue, does burn damage and EMPs targets, and causes a small EMP when dying."
  - rscadd: "Electromagnetic Web takes more damage; a normal blob that hasn't been near a node or the core for 6~ seconds can be oneshotted by a laser."
