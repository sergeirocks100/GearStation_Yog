  - experiment: "New abilities for some races!"
  - rscadd: "Skeletons (liches) and zombies now are much more susceptible to limb loss, but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery."
  - rscadd: "Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly."
  - rscadd: "Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine."
  - rscadd: "For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate if there's no oxygen)."
  - rscadd: "Pod people now mutate if shot with the mutation setting of the floral somatoray."
