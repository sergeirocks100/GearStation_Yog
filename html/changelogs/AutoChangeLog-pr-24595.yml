  - rscadd: "CTF players start with their helmet toggled off, better to see the
whites of their opponents eyes. Very briefly."

instantly when replaced."
  - tweak: "Healing non-critical CTF damage is faster. Remember though, if
you drop into crit, YOU DIE."
  - rscadd: "Admin ghosts can just click directly on the CTF controller to
enable them, in addition to using the Secrets panel."
