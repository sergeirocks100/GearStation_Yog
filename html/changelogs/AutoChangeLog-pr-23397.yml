changes: 
  - rscadd: "Clockwork Marauders now grant their host action buttons to force them to emerge/recall and communicate with them, instead of requiring the host to type their name or use a verb, respectively."
  - rscdel: "Clockwork Marauders no longer see their block and counter chances; this was mostly useless info, as knowing the chance didn't matter as to what you'd do."
  - rscdel: "Clockwork Marauders can no longer change their name."
  - tweak: "Clockwork Marauders have a slightly lower chance to block, and take slightly more damage when far from their host."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug where Clockwork Marauders never suffered reduced damage and speed at low health and never got the damage bonus at high health."
