  - rscadd: "Smuggler satchels left behind hidden on the station can now reappear in a later round."
  - experiment: "There's absolutely no way of knowing when exactly it will reappear however..."
  - rscadd: "Only one item in the satchel will remain when the satchel reappears."
  - rscadd: "Items are saved in their <b>initial</b> forms, so saving things like chemical grenades will only disappoint you."
  - rscadd: "The item pool is map specific and needs to be a certain size before satchels can start reappearing, so get to hiding that loot!"
