  - rscadd: "Adds the Oddjob Syndikit Special bundle, which turns a Syndicate agent into a small, scampering, well-dressed fedora-thrower that possesses a vague Goldeneye loadout"
  - tweak: "Syndicate fedora now has 15 AP, -10 wound bonus, 10 bare wound bonus. Only bulky when extended now, and can no longer embed"
