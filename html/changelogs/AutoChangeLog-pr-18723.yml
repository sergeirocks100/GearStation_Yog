  - rscadd: "Due to budget cuts, the shuttle's hyperspace engines now create a visual distortion at their destination, a few seconds before arrival. Crewmembers are encouraged to use these \"ripples\" as an indication of where not to stand."
  - bugfix: "Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather than the entire rectangle."
