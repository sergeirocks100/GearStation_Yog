  - rscadd: "Adds a new, lava themed planet to mine on,with randomly generated rivers of lava and islands of volcanic rock. This mine is used on Box and Metastation. Other mappers may enable it at their discretion."
  - rscadd: "Added deadly ash storms to mining."
  - rscadd: "Added slightly deadlier variants of mining mobs to lavaland, with sprites done by my girlfriend."
  - rscadd: "Added portable survival capsules to mining equipment lockers. Don't forget these, or you might get caught out by a storm. You may purchase more at the venders."
  - rscadd: "Added randomly loaded ruins to mining. These maps contain new and unique items not seen elsewhere in thegame. There are around a dozen of them added with the \"release\" of lavaland, though I plan for many more."
  - rscadd: "Some ruins contain sleepers which allow you to spawn as various roles, such as survivors of a shuttle crash stranded in the wilderness. You can find these sleepers in the orbit list."
  - rscadd: "You can now fly the abandoned white ship to lavaland."
