changes: 
  - tweak: "Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables."
  - tweak: "Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze."
  - rscadd: "Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable, acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes unconscious or dies, it will leap free."
  - rscadd: "Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing a normal airlock or from Ratvar."
  - rscadd: "Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants."
  - bugfix: "Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors."
  - bugfix: "Servants are now deconverted properly."
