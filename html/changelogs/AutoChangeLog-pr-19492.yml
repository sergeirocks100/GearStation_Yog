changes: 
  - tweak: "Clockwork Sigils will now be destroyed by any level of explosion, except for Sigils of Transmission, which will gain a small amount of power if hit by a light explosion instead of breaking."
  - bugfix: "Clockwork Structures will now properly take damage from explosions instead of variably not taking damage or instantly being destroyed."
