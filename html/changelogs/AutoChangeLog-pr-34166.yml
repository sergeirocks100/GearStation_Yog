changes: 
  - rscadd: "Reworked the species side of xenobiology."
  - rscadd: "Instead of an universal unstable mutation toxin, green slimes can now produce slime mutation toxin (plasma), human mutation toxin (blood), and lizard mutation toxin (radium)."
  - balance: "Slime mutation toxin requires several units and some time before acting, unless you're already a slimeperson (in which case it will randomize your subspecies)"
  - rscadd: "Two new jellypeople subspecies have been added to make up for the lost species."
  - rscadd: "Stargazers have telepathic abilities; they can Send Thoughts, privately and anonimously, to any target they can see, and they can Link Minds with any aggressively grabbed mob to form a hivemind with them. Hiveminds have no limit but expire when the Stargazer dies or changes species."
  - rscadd: "Luminescents glow faintly and can absorb slime cores to gain special abilities. Each core has a minor and a major ability, generally based on what they normally do. Using these abilities does not use up the cores, but it has a cooldown depending on the ability's power."
  - balance: "Slimepeople can now switch bodies on death or when unconscious, as long as they have another one."
