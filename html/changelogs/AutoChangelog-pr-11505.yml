  - rscadd: "New Non-Human species specific Command position enrollment!"
  - rscadd: "A new entry in the game_options.txt which allows quick adding and subtracting of allowed Species / Command position combinations (JOB_SPECIES_WHITELIST)!"
  - wip: "If this PR survives the testmerge period and goes to fullmerge, other modular additions will be looked into, such as Command envirosuits for CE/RD Plasmapeople! This was deferred to prevent tying up of valuable Spriter time and resources."
  - experiment: "If you find anything working not as intended with this testmerge active, or you'd like to give your thoughts / feedback on the PR, please say something on the Yogstation Discord to me at Gavius#3817 or leave a comment here!"
