changes: 
  - rscadd: "48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left). While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station, for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit."
  - rscadd: "96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale."
