changes: 
  - bugfix: "transcendent olfaction can now smell people through lockers since another two inches of metal shouldn't stop it any more than the 5 walls it's already working through"
  - tweak: "transcendent olfaction now will only obliterate the user's nose if the miasma mole count is 0.1 or over"
