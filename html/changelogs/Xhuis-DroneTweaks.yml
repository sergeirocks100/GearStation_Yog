changes: 
  - rscadd: "Maintenance drones now have a more descriptive message when examined."
  - tweak: "A recent Nanotrasen firmware update to drones has increased vulnerability to foreign influences. Please periodically check drones for abnormal behavior or status LED malfunction. Note, however, that cryptographic sequencers will not incur this behavior."
  - tweak: "In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench."
  - experiment: "Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible, when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their wrath!"
