  - rscadd: "Added a Ghost On-screen HUD. It can be toggled using the \"Toggle Ghost HUD\" verb. Thank you Razharas for the sprites!"
  - rscadd: "Ghosts can now use the \"Toggle med/sec HUD\" verb to see the basic secHUD (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans."
  - rscadd: "Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled."
