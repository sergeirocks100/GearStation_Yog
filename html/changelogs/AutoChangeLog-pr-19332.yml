changes: 
  - experiment: "The Vanguard scripture no longer prevents you from using slabs while active, but you cannot reactivate it if it is currently active."
  - tweak: "It now only lasts 20 seconds, instead of 30."
  - tweak: "When Vanguard deactivates, it now stuns for half the time of all stuns absorbed, instead of all of them."
