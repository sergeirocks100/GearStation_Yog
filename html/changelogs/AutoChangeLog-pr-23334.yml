changes: 
  - tweak: "Geis now mutes human targets if there are less than 6 Servants."
  - tweak: "Geis no longer produces resist messages below 6 Servants; this isn't a change, as Geis cannot be successfully resisted below 6 Servants."
  - tweak: "Applying Geis to an already bound target will also mute them, in addition to preventing resistance."
