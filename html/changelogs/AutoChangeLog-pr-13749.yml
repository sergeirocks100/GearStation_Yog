changes: 
  - tweak: "Reduces Lexorin Jelly's oxygen damage significantly."
  - experiment: "Blobbernaut chemical application on attack is back, but much less absurd this time; blobbernauts with an overmind will do 70% of the normal chem damage(plus 4) and attack at a much slower rate than the blob itself can."
  - wip: "As an example, a blobbernaut with the Ripping Tendrils chemical would do 14.5 brute and 10.5 stamina damage per hit."
