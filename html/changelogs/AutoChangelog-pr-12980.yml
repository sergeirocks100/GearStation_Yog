changes: 
  - tweak: "weapons can now have a slowdown applied to their user on hit, and have differing attack cooldowns/take damage on attack"
  - tweak: "spears now have 2 range when wielded, but slightly slow the user when attacking while wielded. Spears crafted from glass shards can break from heavy use"
  - tweak: "carrot shivs and shanks can attack slightly faster, but can break after repeated use"
