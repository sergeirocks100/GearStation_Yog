  - rscadd: "Singularity containment has been replaced on box, meta, and delta with a supermatter room. The supermatter gives ample warning when melting down, so hopefully we'll see fewer 15 minute rounds ended by a loose singularity."
  - rscadd: "Supermatter crystals now collapse into singularities when they fail, rather than explode."
