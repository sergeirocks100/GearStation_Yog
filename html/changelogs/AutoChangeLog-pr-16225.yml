changes: 
  - imageadd: "The default white ghost form now has directional sprites."
  - rscadd: "The default white ghost form now also has (your) hair! Here's how it works."
  - experiment: "If you ghost from a body, you'll get the hair from that body. If it has hair."
  - experiment: "If you hit Observe, you'll get the hair from the character you had active in your setup window. If they had hair."
  - wip: "This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the other forms have the wrong shape or lack directional sprites), and with human bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen! You'll get your turn next time."
  - rscadd: "A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional sprites or just use its original default version without directional sprites."
  - rscadd: "A new preference called Ghosts of Others. This preference is clientside and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting, as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the simple white ghost sprite if you're sick of those premium users with their rainbow ghosts."
  - experiment: "The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization, which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you."
