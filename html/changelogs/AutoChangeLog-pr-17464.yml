changes: 
  - tweak: "Sporing Pods produces spores when expanding slightly more often."
  - tweak: "Replicating Foam now only expands when hit with burn damage, from all damage, but does so at a higher chance. Free expansion from it is, however, more rare."
  - tweak: "Penetrating Spines does slightly more brute damage, and Poisonous Strands does its damage 50% faster."
