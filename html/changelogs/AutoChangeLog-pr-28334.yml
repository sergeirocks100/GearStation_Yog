  - tweak: "Traitor AIs' malfunction modules have received a firmware update and are more responsive, with HUD buttons and more sensible menus."
  - tweak: "Overload and Override Machines now function differently; instead of right-clicking a machine to choose a context menu option, you activate the ability, which lets you left-click on a machine to overload or override it. This also changes your cursor."
