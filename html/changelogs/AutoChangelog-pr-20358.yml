changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed IPCs with no uniform having IDs that cannot be stolen or removed via the inventory menu"
  - spellcheck: "In the inventory menu, people who do not need their uniform to hold their belt/ID/etc. now display their inventory slightly differently, hopefully enough to remind you to strip IPCs completely when you need to."
