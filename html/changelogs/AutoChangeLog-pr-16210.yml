changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds lightning holoparasites, which have medium damage resist, a weak attack, have a lightning chain to their summoner, and apply lightning chains when attacking targets."
  - rscadd: "Lightning chains shock everyone nearby, doing low burn damage. This is excluding the parasite and summoner; chains will shock enemies they're attached to."
  - tweak: "Holoparasites can now smash tables and lockers."
