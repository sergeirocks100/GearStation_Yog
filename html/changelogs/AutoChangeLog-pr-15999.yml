changes: 
  - rscdel: "Blob gamemode blobs will no longer burst from people."
  - rscadd: "Instead, the blob gamemode spawns overminds, which can place their blob core underneath them in an unobserved area."
  - rscadd: "The overminds can, until they have placed a blob core, move to any non-space, non-shuttle tile."
  - rscadd: "If the overminds fail to place a blob core within a time limit, it will be automatically placed for them at a random blob spawnpoint."
  - tweak: "The time before the overmind automatically places the core is slightly lower than the previous average time it'd take a blob to burst."
