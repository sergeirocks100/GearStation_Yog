changes: 
  - tweak: "Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience."
  - bugfix: "Gravity guns now have an inhand sprite."
