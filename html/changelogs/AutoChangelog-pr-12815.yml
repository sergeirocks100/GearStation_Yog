changes: 
  - rscadd: "Instead of being based out of an AI core, the AI is now based out of different data cores around the station. Kill all of these to kill the AI"
  - rscadd: "Added servers that can be created and filled with new CPU/RAM cards. These will allow the AI to research and use special upgrades"
  - rscadd: "Creating and stealing the AI is now done through the AI upload console. These can be created anywhere but requires the use of a password that starts in the RDs office."
  - rscdel: "Deleted the ability to create regular AI cores"
  - tweak: "AI HUD now wraps down to 1 line if playing in widescreen"
  - tweak: "When compiling using VSCode you will now automatically run DreamDaemon instead of DreamSeeker. This means hotkeys/movement keys work correctly."
  - experiment: "AI now suffers permadeath if all their cores are knocked offline"
