  - experiment: "SDQL2 has been refactored to a datum!"
  - rscadd: "A new SDQL2 panel has been added to admin tabs, for tracking, VVing, and halting SDQL2 queries."
  - rscadd: "SDQL2 documentation is now available in SDQL_2.dm"
  - rscadd: "SDQL2 now has MAP added. MAP will cause the query to execute on whatever is specified in MAP, whether it's a variable or a procedure call (which will grab the return results), etc etc."
  - rscadd: "SDQL2 now has a superuser mode, for uses outside of admin button pressing. This causes it to operate without admin protection wrapping."
  - rscadd: "SDQL2 now supports options, including ignoring nulls in select or forcing it to operate in high priority mode, which lets it use 95% of the tick instead of obeying the Master Controller's tick limit. USE WITH CAUTION. Also includes a mode for blocking proccalls"
  - rscadd: "SDQL2 now supports TRUE/FALSE."
  - rscadd: "To use options, append OPTIONS to the query. Available are \"PRIORITY\" = HIGH/NORMAL, \"SELECT\" = FORCE_NULLS/DISABLE or 0/FALSE, \"PROCCALL\" = ASYNC/BLOCKING."
