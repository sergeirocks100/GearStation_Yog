  - tweak: ""Many toxins are now more or less efficient.""
  - tweak: ""The descriptions of many reagents have been made more accurate.""
  - rscadd: ""New poison: Heparin. Made from Formaldehyde, Sodium, Chlorine, and Lithium. Functions as an anticoagulant, inducing uncontrollable bleeding and small amounts of bruising.""
  - rscadd: ""New poison: Teslium. Made from Plasma, Silver, and Black Powder, heated to 400K. Modifies examine text and induces periodic shocks in the victim as well as making all shocks against them more damaging.""
  - rscadd: ""Two Chemistry books have been placed in the lab. When used, they will link to the wiki page for chemistry in the same vein as other wiki books."

I frequently play Chemist, and I've found that a few wonder drugs tend to make others useless, and not even worth creating. This PR attempts to make underused medicines worth creating by increasing their healing effects.

Medicine Changes

Medicine descriptions have been made more descriptive.
Synaptizine now has a 30% chance to cause toxin damage (down from 60%).
Rezadone now instantly heals all clone damage.
Rezadone's negative effects are now an overdose effect that kicks in at 30u.
Oxandralone now heals 4 burn damage if burns are severe (up from 2).
Morphine now makes victims drowsy at 12 cycles, with the old sleeping effect kicking in at 24 cycles.
Miner's Salve now stuns and weakens for 4 ticks when ingested/injected rather than applied via touch (up from 2).
Miner's Salve now gives a message when used properly hinting at its use as a painkiller.
Pentetic Acid no longer has a small chance to cause bruising.
Oculine now heals eye damage before 15 cycles and gives messages upon blindness and nearsightedness being removed.
Atropine now heals all damage types by 2 each tick if the patient is in critical condition and completely halts losebreath.
Diphenhydramine now has a 10% chance to cause drowsiness (down from 50%).
Diphenhydramine now removes 3 units of Histamine per tick (up from 1.5).
Epinephrine's healing effects now function when the patient is in critical condition at all.

Toxin Changes

Amatoxin now deals 2.5 toxin damage (up from 1).
Lexorin is now much more effective due to its inferiority to similar chemicals that cost less to make.
New toxin: Heparin. Made from Formaldehyde, Sodium, Chlorine, and Lithium. This functions as an aggressive anticoagulant, inducing uncontrollable bleeding that even bandages won't stop. Bleeding in this manner has a unique examine text.
New toxin: Teslium. Made from Plasma, Silver, and Black Powder, heated to 400K. Teslium modifies human examine text ("They are emitting a gentle blue glow!") and periodically induces shocks of varying strength. The shocks themselves happen often but unpredictably, and bypass clothing protection because it's inside the bloodstream.

Miscellaneous Changes

Two chemistry wiki books have been added to the Chemistry Lab"
