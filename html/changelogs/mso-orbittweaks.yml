changes: 
  - rscdel: "Removed feature where quick consecutive ghost orbits while moving could be used to fuck with your sprite"
  - bugfix: "Fixed ghosts losing floating animation when returning from an orbit"
  - bugfix: "Fixed logic error that prevented orbit's automatic cancel when the orbiting thing moved in certain situations."
  - rscadd: "Ghost Orbit size now changes based on the icon size of the thing they are orbiting (for that sweet sweet singulo orbiting action)"
  - tweak: "Removed needless checks in ghost orbit, you can now orbit yourself and restart an orbit around the thing you are already orbiting"
