  - rscadd: "You can now cancel out of selecting a robot module!"
  - imagedel: "Robot modules now only have a generic transform animation when selected; the borg is locked in place for 5 seconds in a small cloud of smoke while the base borg sprite fades out and the new module fades in."
  - tweak: "Resetting a borg will do that animation."
