  - rscadd: "Added reinforced bolas. They do a very short stun in addition to normal functions, and take twice as long to break out of when compared to regular bolas."
  - tweak: "The traitor's Throwing Star Box has been made into the Throwing Weapons Box. It now contains two reinforced bolas in addition to its old contents. It also costs 5 TCs, down from 6."
