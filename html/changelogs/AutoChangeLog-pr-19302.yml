changes: 
  - tweak: "Infernal jaunt now has a cooldown, to prevent trying to jaunt while already jaunting.  This should have no practical changes."
  - bugfix: "Infernal jaunt no longer occasionally leaves you permanently on fire."
  - bugfix: "Pitchforks no longer burn devils and soul-sellers, as intended."
