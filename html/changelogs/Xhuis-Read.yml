changes: 
  - rscadd: "Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways..."
  - tweak: "When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all items on the mob."
