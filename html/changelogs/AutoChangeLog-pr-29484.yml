changes: 
  - balance: "Geis now mutes for 12-14 seconds and \"stuns\" the target, via a binding effect, for 25 seconds instead of initiating a conversion."
  - experiment: "Geis's \"stun\" restrains the target and prevents them from taking actions, but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant."
  - wip: "Using Geis on a target prevents you from taking actions other than attempting to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any time."
  - wip: "As should be obvious, if the binding is destroyed or dispelled, you can once again take normal actions."
  - tweak: "Sigils of Submission are now permanent and have been moved from the Script tier to the Driver tier, with an according cost adjustment. They still do not penetrate mindshield implants."
  - rscdel: "Removed Taunting Tirade."
  - rscdel: "Removed Sigils of Accession."
