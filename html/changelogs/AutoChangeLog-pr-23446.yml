  - rscadd: "You can regain a use of a soapstone by erasing one of your own
messages. (This means you can remove a message if you don't like the
colour and want to try rephrasing it to get a better colour). Erasing
someone else's message still uses a charge."
  - bugfix: "Fixes bugs where you'd spend a charge without engraving anything."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug where the wrong ckey was entered in the engraving,
you won't be able to take advantage of the \"recharging\" on messages made
before this change."
