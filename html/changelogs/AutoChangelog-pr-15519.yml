changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds .357 Ironfeather for 1 TC, a round type that fires a weaker buckshot clump, but has slightly more favorable damage and wound dropoff."
  - rscadd: "Adds .357 Nutcracker for 2 TC, a round type that's effectively an upgraded breaching slug, doing half the damage of a normal round but massive damage to airlocks and windows."
  - rscadd: "Adds .357 Metalshock for 2 TC, a round type that converts some brute damage into a shock that confuses targets. Insuls prevent the damage and the effect, making it a weaker bullet if you have immunity."
  - rscadd: "Adds .357 Heartpiercer for 3 TC, a round type comparable to a standard AP round, but has the ability to penetrate through one target to hit a total of two."
  - rscadd: "Adds .357 Wallstake for 4 TC, a round type which does lessened, blunt damage, but throws targets like the baseball bat or meteorshot. Will only stun if a target hits a wall."
  - tweak: "Normal .357 speedloader costs 1 TC from 2 TC"
  - imageadd: "Adds sprites for the three new ammo types"
  - experiment: "Who said ballistics can't be quirky?"
