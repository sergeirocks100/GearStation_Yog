changes: 
  - tweak: "Tesla balance changes"
  - tweak: "Tesla will now require increasingly more energy to trigger new orbiting balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256 (down from 1200), and so on and on, doubling with each new ball. Balls after 7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier to get."
  - rscadd: "MULTIBOLT IS BACK!"
  - tweak: "Be warned that in multibolt all but 1 primary bolt now have a random shocking range, meaning they may still target a close human over a far away grounding rod as the rod may be out of range."
  - tweak: "Power output of tesla massively dropped, it should no longer put out almost twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls, you'll need at least 3 balls for that now."
  - tweak: "Tesla can now lose power, causing ball count to drop. Tesla will never shrink out of existence, just lose its balls."
  - tweak: "Tesla is now more likely to head in the direction of the thing it last zapped."
