				<li class="bugfix">Previously, improving the incinerator's efficiency made the RPM decay more quickly, instead of less quickly. No more!</li>

			<h3 class="author">phil235 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">A whole bunch of structures and machines can now be broken and destroyed using conventional attack methods.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The effect of fire on objects is overhauled. When on fire, your external clothes now take fire damage and can become ashes, unless fire proof. All objects caught in a fire can now take fire damage, instead of just flammable ones, unless fire proof.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acid effect is overhauled. Splashing acid on something puts a green effect on it and start slowly melting it. Throwing acid on mobs puts acid on their clothes. Acid can destroy structures and items alike, as long as they're not acid proof. The more acid put on an object, the faster it melts. Walking on an acid puddle puts acid on your shoes or burns your bare feet. Picking up an item with acid without adequate glove protection burns your hand. Acid can be washed away with any sort of water source (extinguisher, shower, water glass,etc...).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When a mob receives melee attacks, its clothes also get damaged. Clothes with enough damage get a visual effect. Damaged clothes can be repaired with cloth (produced with botany's biogenerator). Clothes that receives too much melee damage become shreds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking a structure/machine with an item on help intent can never result in an attack.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hostile animals that are environment destroyers no longer destroys tables&closets in one hit. It now takes several hits depending on the animal.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Incoming5643 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The secret satchels system has been updated to hide more smuggler's satchels hidden randomly under the station</li>
				<li class="experiment">In case you forgot about the secret satchel system, basically if you take a smuggler's satchel (a traitor item also occasionally found under a random tile in the station [USE T-RAYS]), stow away an item in it, and bury it under the floor tiles that item can reappear in a random later round!</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added E-cigarettes as contraband to cigarettes vending machines. They take reagents instead of dried plants and also hold more than cigarettes or pipes. You can modify them to puff out clouds of reagents or emag them to fill a whole room with reagent vapor.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Lizards can now choose to have digitigrade legs (those weird backwards bending ones). Keep in mind that they can only be properly seen in rather short pants. They also preclude the use of shoes. By default no lizard will have these legs, you have to opt in.</li>
