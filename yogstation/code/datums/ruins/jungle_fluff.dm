	info = {"I am at the end now. Many days and many nights have passed since I began my journey from our sanctuary across the isles.
I was told this crystal was the key to bringing an end to the cancer of our world. I was told I would be prepared to face Him...
Hope was the one thing carrying me through my voyage and all that I've had to face. But now I realize they were all lies.
This crystal, this key that I have risked my life to carry here, doesn't even fit into the altar! All this time... I put my life into the hands of a mere broken shard.

My flask ran dry days ago. I am too far and too weak to go back. There's only the quiet now...

If any of you find this, I'm so sorry. I couldn't do it.
