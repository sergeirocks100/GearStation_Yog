	info = "<i> The text is written in shaky handwriting, and is barely readable. <i> <br> <br> Rose achieved enlightenment yesterday. <br> <br> She didn't go as peacefully as she always said she would, so we had to give her a hand. We planned on giving her a... funeral of sorts by dumping her body outside, but we found out that when you've been stuck with no fuel for months, you'll do anything for a bite to eat. Her earthly remains didn't go to waste. <br> <br> Fuel's running low. Not sure how long the rest of us will last. <br> <br> I'm planning on giving myself a last ride with the sweet angel of ecstasy, but the others can't know. <br> <br> The stars are so fucking beautiful out here, man."
