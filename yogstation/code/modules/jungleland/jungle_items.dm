				<h1>Ancient Ivymen Recipes</h1>
				I pass down my knowledge to my kin, all that I know shall forever be preserved in this book.
				Inside, I shall teach you various important healing recipes and crafting techniques.
				<h2>Poultice:</h2>
				To prepare, first gather wood, a mortar and pestle, cinchona bark, ashes from a burnt item, a barrel, and a heat source such as a welder/lit candle.
				Next, place the cinchona bark inside the barrel for it to ferment.
				While the cinchona ferments, grind 2 planks of wood in the mortar and burn an item such as wood in fire for ashes.
				Afterwards, scoop up ashes with the mortar and distill the fermented cinchona. If the ashes are warm enough, it may mix without extra heat needed.
				If it has yet to mix, heat up the bowl by using the welder on it until it has done so.
				Apply product to wounded parts to heal them. May cause loss of breath.
				<h2>Sterilizine:</h2>
				To prepare, acquire a wooden barrel and cinchona bark.
				Place the cinchona in the barrel to ferment.
				Once done, the product can be used for making poultice or using in surgery.
				<h2>Flora:</h2>
				Every plant we are blessed with can be used in some way. 
				Liberal hats can be used to free the mind for a pleasant time.
				Cinchona bark can heal wounds when consumed, or fermented for sterilizine and poultice.
				<h2>Leather:</h2>
				Leather does not need to be interacted with much as a shaman,
				especially if you are prioritizing medicine.
				However, it can still be useful to know how to make it,
				Especially since you can use it, or cloth, to create a medicinal pouch useful for holding plants and medicines.
				To create it, acquire some hide, the most available of which will be goliath hide.
				Next, skin it well with a sharp tool.
				Afterwards, wash with water thoroughly, and then dry by placing it over a grill atop a lit bonfire.
				<h2>Meduracha Toxin:</h2>
				The toxins off of meduracha tentacles can be harvested.
				Grind their tentacles in a mortar and pestle to obtain it.
				It is deadly and causes confusion in targets, and is useful in blowguns against humans.
