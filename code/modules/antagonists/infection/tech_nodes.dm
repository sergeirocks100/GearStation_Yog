//infra, 5x5 passive buff structures for the crew, have ocular warden esque anti-overlap and can't be placed behind the current combat zone
// energy pylons that recharge guns in their range
// turret pylons that passively damages nearby infection
//

//bio, gives buffs to crew health sustainability with new or improved medical equipment
// sleeper upgrade that makes sleepers heal 6 points instead of 2
// syringe gun that fires pre-loaded piercing syringes of reskinned syndicate nanites, cooldown per shot is both global per person and per gun
