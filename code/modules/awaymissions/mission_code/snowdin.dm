	circuitry or something. Without a constant supply of resources from central command, our stock is getting awfully low. Some of the security members have taken to
	using the sparse rifle ammo left to hunting some of the wildlife to try and keep our food supply from emptying. God forbid if the heating goes out, I don't want to
	die as a fucking popsicle down here."}

	info = {"<b><center>ACTIVITY LOG</b></center><br><br><b>June 3rd</b><br>We've moved to the main base in the valley finally, apparently establishing a listening system on a planet
	that never stops fucking snowing is a great idea. There's a few outposts further south we'll be supplying from the main gateway. The summer months are enough already, I can only imagine how bad it'll be during winter.<br><br><b>August 23rd</b><br>
	The colder months are finally hitting, some of the machinery seems to be having trouble starting up sometimes. Central sent some portable heaters to help keep the airlocks from
	freezing shut along with a couple storage crates with supplies. Nothing on the radio so far, what the hell do they even expect to hear down here, anyway?<br><br><b>September 15th</b>
	<br>Another supply shipment through the gateway, they've sent some heavier sets of clothes for the coming winter months. Central said they might encounter issues with shipments
	during December to Feburary, so we should try to be frugal with the next shipment.<br><br><b>November 20th</b><br>Final shipment from central for the next few months. Going outside
	for more than 10-15 minutes without losing feeling in your fingers is difficult. We've finally gotten a signal on the radio, its mostly some weird static though. One of the researchers is trying to decypher it.
	<br><br><b>December 10th</b><br>Signal has gotten much stronger, it almost seems like its coming from under us according to what the researcher managed to decypher. We're waiting from the go from central before investigating.<br><br>
	<i>The rest of the paper seems to be a mixture of scribles and smudged ink.</i> "}
