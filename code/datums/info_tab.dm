	section_text = "With the ice cream vat, you can select and dispense both ice cream scoops and cones, along with scooping ice cream scoops onto cones. The selected scoop will be what is scooped into cones, while the selected cone is what is dispensed by alt-clicking the vat. To scoop ice cream into a cone, select a scoop type that the vat has and then right-click the vat with an empty cone. Cones can only have one scoop of ice cream."

	section_text = "The ice cream vat can be restocked with new ice cream scoops and cones by left-clicking on the vat with said item. The vat can also be restocked by left-clicking on the vat with an ice cream carton with scoops. Doing so will transfer the scoops into the vat. To get more ice cream, you can either make more scoops or buy them from cargo. To get more cones, you will have to make their raw form from the crafting menu and then process them with a food processor."

	section = "Creating New Scoops"
	section_text = "To Create new scoops, you will need to get 10u of any given ice cream flavor and then mix it with 2u of ice. Doing so will give you one scoop of ice cream. To make ice cream reagents, you will need to start with plain ice cream. Plain ice cream is made by mixing 5u of cream, 3u of sugar, 2u of salt, and then cooling it to 272 Kelvin. To make the reagents of flavored ice cream, mix 10u of plain ice cream with 2u of the desired flavor. For vanilla, this is vanilla powder. For chocolate, it is coco powder. For strawberry, it is berry juice. For blue, it is singulo. For lemon sorbet, it is lemon juice. For caramel, it is caramel. For banana, it is banana juice. For orange creamsicle, it is orange juice. For peach, it is peach juice. For meat lovers, it is liquid gibs. Cherry chocolate is the exception, as it requires 10u of chocolate ice cream rather than plain ice cream. Its flavor reagent is cherry jelly. Flavored ice cream reagents do not need to be cooled down to be made like plain ice cream does, but only return 10u rather than 12u of reagents."

	section_text = "Cones are made in the crafting menu in the misc. food tab. They require a raw pastry base and 2u of their flavor reagent. For cake cones, this is sugar. For chocolate cones, this is coco powder. Once you have made the raw cone, process it with a food processor to turn it into a finished cone."
