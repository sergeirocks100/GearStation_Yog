# This file contains filters required for replacements in supported speech systems.
# Each line contains one pattern and one replacement. The patterns used are regular
# expression patterns. 
#
# Examples:
# 
# fuck=duck
# 	This would replace all instances of "fuck" with duck. So "fucking" would become "ducking".
#
# fu+ck=duck
#	This would do the same as above, except it would accept one or more "u". So "fuuuuuck" would become "duck".
#
# Activate the ([\S]+?)=use $1
#	This would match a group, and use it in a pattern. So "Activate the probulator" would become "use probulator".
# 
# \b[f]+[u]+\b=fun you
#	This would make any word with combinations of "f" followed by "u" be replaced with fun you. So "ffffffffuuuuuuuuuuu" becomes "fun you".
# Note that you do NOT have to escape these regexes as if they were BYOND strings. They'll be treated properly.
